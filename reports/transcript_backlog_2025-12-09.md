## Next Actions
1) For each "New" transcript: generate ~20 MCQ/True-False questions (use the documented questioning method in `Anki-Decks/README.md`), append to CSV, and regenerate the deck via `create_master_deck.py`.
2) After conversion, add the filename to `.processed_transcripts.log` and remove it from the backlog on the next snapshot.
3) Keep this backlog file updated when new transcripts arrive; date-stamp new snapshots in `reports/` to preserve history.
