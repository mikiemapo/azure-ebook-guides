"Your team needs instant detection of a CPU spike on a production VM—latency must be under one minute. Which Azure Monitor data type supports the fastest alerting?","Log search data (KQL-based)","Activity logs (control plane events)","Metrics (1-minute granularity, near-real-time)","Diagnostic logs stored in Log Analytics","C","Metrics provide near-real-time ingestion (≈1 min). Best for CPU/memory thresholds.","AzureMonitor,Metrics,Alerts","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"A developer wants to detect patterns such as ‘more than 500 HTTP 404s across multiple VMs in the past hour.’ Which signal type is required?","Metrics","Log search (KQL analysis)","Activity logs","Diagnostic settings","B","Only KQL log search alerts can aggregate and analyze multi-resource patterns.","AzureMonitor,Logs,KQL","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"GOLDEN RULE: When choosing between metrics, logs, and activity log alerts, what is the primary decision factor?","Cost of the data type","Time sensitivity + complexity of analysis + purpose","Diagnostic settings configuration","Number of resources","B","Metrics = real-time; Logs = deep analysis; Activity Logs = control-plane changes.","AzureMonitor,BestPractice","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"A security team wants to detect when a firewall rule is modified. Which alert type applies?","Metric alert","Log search alert","Activity log alert","Diagnostic log alert","C","Activity Logs track ARM-level config changes (firewalls, NSGs, VM actions).","AzureMonitor,ActivityLog","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"Your environment includes 200 subs and must enforce diagnostic settings everywhere. Which Azure Policy effect applies missing settings?","Audit","Disabled","DeployIfNotExists","Append","C","DIN validates and deploys missing diagnostic settings automatically.","AzurePolicy,DIN","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"GOLDEN RULE: To enforce diagnostic settings consistently, Azure Policy must use:","Audit","AuditIfNotExists","DeployIfNotExists","Modify","C","DIN is the only effect that auto-creates required configurations.","AzurePolicy,Governance","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"During a review a team claims Policy ensures all logs go to a workspace. Which question validates automation?","Which subscriptions are included?","How often is policy evaluated?","Does it use DeployIfNotExists or only Audit?","Where is the workspace located?","C","If it's not DIN, it's not automated enforcement.","AzurePolicy,Governance","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"An alert fires during scheduled maintenance. How do you suppress notifications without disabling alerts?","Activity log alerts","Alert processing rules","Disable the alert rule","Use a custom metric threshold","B","Processing rules suppress notifications, not alert logic.","AzureMonitor,ProcessingRules","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"How do alert processing rules interact with alert rules?","They stop alert evaluation","They modify alert logic","Rules fire normally; processing rules apply after","They disable alerts","C","Alert fires → processing rule applies filtering afterward.","AzureMonitor,ProcessingRules","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"You need to suppress High CPU alerts Sundays 2–4 AM but still want alert history. What do you use?","Log search alert","Delayed metric alert","Alert processing rule (scheduled)","Activity log suppression","C","Processing rules silence notifications on a schedule without disabling alerts.","AzureMonitor,ProcessingRules","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"Which signal type is most cost-efficient for high-frequency monitoring across hundreds of VMs?","Log search","Metrics","Activity logs","Diagnostic logs","B","Metrics are cheap, fast, optimized for high-frequency monitoring.","AzureMonitor,Metrics","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"Correct mapping for: immediate anomaly detection + deep analysis + config tracking?","Logs, Metrics, Activity Logs","Metrics, Logs, Activity Logs","Activity Logs, Metrics, Logs","Logs, Activity Logs, Metrics","B","Metrics = real-time; Logs = analytics; Activity = config changes.","AzureMonitor,Signals","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
"GOLDEN RULE: Core alert hierarchy in Azure Monitor?","Diagnostic settings → Logs → Alerts","Metric alerts → Log alerts → Activity alerts","Alert evaluates → alert created → processing rule applied","Alerts fire → resources restart","C","Evaluation → alert instance → processing rule.","AzureMonitor,AlertFlow","Monitoring Deep Dive","Batch 2"
