"A CPU alert fires every 5 minutes on a VM, but investigation shows short-lived CPU spikes that aren't actually impacting the application. What's the best fix?","Lower the CPU threshold","Increase evaluation period & aggregation (e.g., avg over 15 minutes)","Disable the alert","Switch alert type to log-based KQL only",B,"Short spikes shouldn't alert; extending evaluation time smooths volatility and reflects actual load.","Alerts,Metrics,Noise_Reduction",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You want to alert only when a VM's disk queue length trend increases consistently over the last hour. Which feature handles this?","Metric threshold alert","Metric dynamic threshold","Scheduled query brick (log alert)","VM Insights dependency map",C,"Trend-based sustained rise logic requires KQL with scheduled query rules.","Logs,KQL,Trend_Detection",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"A customer wants alerts for any VM reboot (planned or unplanned). Which data source is required?","Metrics","VM Insights guest metrics","Activity Log","Workbooks",C,"VM reboots appear in Activity Log as platform events; metrics cannot detect reboot events.","Activity_Log,Alerts,Platform_Events",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You run AzureActivity queries to detect unauthorized role assignments, but logs show delays of several minutes. Why?","Wrong workspace tier","Activity Log → Log Analytics ingestion latency","VM Insights agent misconfiguration","Log retention too low",B,"Activity Log ingestion has natural latency (up to minutes); not real-time.","Activity_Log,Latency,KQL",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You're building a dashboard combining CPU, Disk IOPS, and custom query output. Which feature?","Azure Monitor overview","Workbooks","Metrics Explorer","Alerts portal",B,"Workbooks blend logs + metrics + visuals into one interactive dashboard.","Workbooks,Dashboards",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You need to correlate a VM's CPU spike with a sudden increase in network flows. Which tool?","VM Insights only","Activity Log","Network Watcher + Logs workbook","Metrics Explorer",C,"Network Watcher provides flow logs; use a workbook to correlate with metrics.","Network_Watcher,Logs,Correlation",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"A customer wants an alert when no logs have been received from a critical VM for 30 minutes. Which approach?","Metric alert on CPU","Activity Log","Scheduled query alert with heartbeat missing logic","VM Insights",C,"Heartbeat loss detection requires KQL scheduled query rules.","Heartbeat,KQL,Monitoring",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"Your alert rule must trigger if ANY VM in a scale set crosses 90% CPU. Best approach?","Create alert per VM","Create a resource group-wide alert","Use a multi-resource metric alert","Use Activity Log alerts",C,"Multi-resource alerts evaluate multiple VMs at once with a single rule.","Metrics,Scale_Sets,Multi-Resource",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You need to monitor dependency calls between VMs in different subnets. Which component maps dependencies?","Metrics explorer","Activity Log","VM Insights (dependency agent)","Log Analytics",C,"VM Insights dependency agent maps processes, ports, and cross-VM calls.","VM_Insights,Dependency_Map",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You create an alert on a custom metric emitted by your app. But the alert never fires. Why?","Custom metrics must be enabled in Azure Policy","The metric must be in the StandardMetrics namespace","Custom metrics require a standard (not free) workspace","Custom metrics emit into CustomMetrics namespace and need correct selection",D,"Alerts only work if you select the correct metric namespace.","Metrics,Custom_Metrics",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"A log alert is evaluating too slowly. How to speed it up?","Increase lookback","Switch workspace to legacy tier","Narrow the query scope using where TimeGenerated > ago(...)","Add a retention policy",C,"Smaller dataset = faster query execution.","KQL,Performance",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"You want to detect unexpectedly high number of 500 errors in App Service logs. Where should this query run?","Metrics Explorer","Workbooks","Log Analytics (AppServiceHTTPLogs)","Network Watcher",C,"HTTP 500 events are stored in App Service diagnostics → Log Analytics.","App_Service,Logs,KQL",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"A customer needs security-focused insights (failed logins, sign-ins, risk events). Which log source?","AzureActivity","SignInLogs + AuditLogs","Metrics","VM Insights",B,"Identity/security events live in Microsoft Entra Sign-in and Audit logs.","Entra,Logs,Security",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"A customer wants to visualize traffic between subnets and detect unusual spikes. Choose the best solution.","NSG flow logs + Traffic Analytics","App Insights workbook","Metrics Explorer","VM Insights",A,"Flow logs + Traffic Analytics provide subnet-to-subnet visualization and anomaly detection.","Networking,Flow_Logs,Traffic_Analytics",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"GOLDEN RULE: When choosing between metrics, logs, and activity logs, what is the primary decision factor?",Cost,"Time sensitivity + complexity + purpose","Diagnostic settings","VM count",B,"Metrics → immediate. Logs → deep analytics. Activity → control plane events.","Monitoring,Best_Practice",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"Which Azure Policy effect applies missing diagnostic settings?",Audit,Disabled,DeployIfNotExists,Append,C,"DeployIfNotExists enforces and auto-remediates diagnostic settings.","Monitoring,Policy,Governance",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"GOLDEN RULE: For enforcing diagnostic settings at enterprise scale, Azure Policy must use:",Audit,AuditIfNotExists,DeployIfNotExists,Modify,C,"Only DeployIfNotExists actively deploys missing config.","Monitoring,Governance",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"How do alert processing rules interact with alert rules?","Skip evaluation","Modify alert logic","Alert rule fires → processing rule acts afterward","Disable alerts",C,"Alerts evaluate normally; processing rules modify notifications.","Monitoring,Processing_Rules",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
"Correct mapping: anomalies, deep analysis, config changes?","Logs, Metrics, Activity Logs","Metrics, Logs, Activity Logs","Activity Logs, Metrics, Logs","Logs, Activity Logs, Metrics",B,"Metrics → anomalies, Logs → analytics, Activity → config.","Monitoring,Best_Practice",Azure Monitor Deep Dive,Monitor-Merged
