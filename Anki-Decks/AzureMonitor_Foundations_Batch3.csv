"Your team needs instant detection of a CPU spike on a production VM—latency must be under one minute. Which Azure Monitor data type supports the fastest alerting?","Log search data (KQL-based)","Activity logs (control plane events)","Metrics (1-minute granularity, near-real-time)","Diagnostic logs stored in Log Analytics",C,"Metrics are optimized for near-real-time ingestion (≈1-minute latency). Perfect for CPU/memory threshold alerts.","Monitoring,Metrics,Alerts,Deep Dive",Deep Dive: Metrics vs Logs,Monitoring Batch 3
"A developer wants to detect patterns such as more than 500 HTTP 404s across multiple VMs in the past hour. Which signal is required?",Metrics,"Log search (KQL analysis)","Activity logs","Diagnostic settings",B,"Only log search alerts via KQL can aggregate events across time and resources.","Monitoring,KQL,Log Alerts",Deep Dive: Log Search Alerts,Monitoring Batch 3
"GOLDEN RULE: When choosing between metrics, logs, and activity logs, what is the primary decision factor?",Cost,"Time sensitivity + complexity + purpose","Diagnostic settings","VM count",B,"Metrics → immediate. Logs → deep analytics. Activity → control plane events.","Monitoring,Best Practice",Deep Dive: Monitoring Strategy,Monitoring Batch 3
"A security team wants to detect when a firewall rule is modified. Which alert applies?","Metric alert","Log search alert","Activity log alert","Diagnostic log alert",C,"Activity Logs capture control-plane changes like NSG/firewall rule updates.","Monitoring,Activity Logs,Security",Deep Dive: Control Plane,Monitoring Batch 3
"Which Azure Policy effect applies missing diagnostic settings?",Audit,Disabled,DeployIfNotExists,Append,C,"DeployIfNotExists enforces and auto-remediates diagnostic settings.","Monitoring,Policy,Governance",Deep Dive: DIN,Monitoring Batch 3
"GOLDEN RULE: For enforcing diagnostic settings at enterprise scale, Azure Policy must use:",Audit,AuditIfNotExists,DeployIfNotExists,Modify,C,"Only DeployIfNotExists actively deploys missing config.","Monitoring,Governance",Deep Dive: Policy,Monitoring Batch 3
"Architectural review question: What reveals if diagnostic settings are actually automated?","Which subscriptions are included?","How often policy evaluates?","Is the policy using DeployIfNotExists, or just Audit?","Workspace region?",C,"Many teams incorrectly use Audit only—DIN ensures automation.","Monitoring,Governance",Deep Dive: Policy,Monitoring Batch 3
"An alert fires every Sunday at 2 AM during maintenance. How do you suppress notifications without disabling evaluation?","Activity log alert","Alert processing rules","Disable the alert","Change metric threshold",B,"Processing rules suppress notifications AFTER the alert fires.","Monitoring,Processing Rules",Deep Dive: Suppression,Monitoring Batch 3
"How do alert processing rules interact with alert rules?","Skip evaluation","Modify alert logic","Alert rule fires → processing rule acts afterward","Disable alerts",C,"Alerts evaluate normally; processing rules modify notifications.","Monitoring,Processing Rules",Deep Dive: Behavior,Monitoring Batch 3
"Suppress High CPU notifications 2–4 AM Sunday while keeping alert history?","Log search alert","Metric alert with delay","Alert processing rule on schedule","Activity log suppression",C,"Processing rules suppress notifications based on time.","Monitoring,Processing Rules",Deep Dive: Scheduling,Monitoring Batch 3
"Which signal type is most cost-efficient for high-frequency checks?","Log search",Metrics,"Activity logs","Event Hub streaming",B,"Metrics are fast and cheap; logs incur ingestion + query cost.","Monitoring,Metrics,Cost",Deep Dive: Optimization,Monitoring Batch 3
"Correct mapping: anomalies, deep analysis, config changes?","Logs, Metrics, Activity Logs","Metrics, Logs, Activity Logs","Activity Logs, Metrics, Logs","Logs, Activity Logs, Metrics",B,"Metrics → anomalies, Logs → analytics, Activity → config.","Monitoring,Best Practice",Deep Dive: Mapping,Monitoring Batch 3
"GOLDEN RULE: What is the alert lifecycle?","Diag settings → Logs → Alerts","Metric → Log → Activity","Alert evaluates → alert created → processing rule applied","Resource restarts → notification sent",C,"Alerts always evaluate first; processing rules modify behavior afterward.","Monitoring,Alerts,Processing Rules",Deep Dive: Lifecycle,Monitoring Batch 3
