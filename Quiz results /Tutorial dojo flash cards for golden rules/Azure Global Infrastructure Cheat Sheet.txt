connected through a dedicated regional low latency network.
Criteria in choosing a Region:
Location – a region closest to your users minimizes the latency
Features – some features are not available in all regions
Price – the price of services vary from region to region
Each Region is paired within the same geographic area
If the primary region has an outage, you can failover to the secondary
region
You can use paired regions for replication

Regions that are unique when it comes to compliance:
Azure Government Cloud – only US federal, state, local, and tribal
governments and their partners have access to this dedicated
instance
China Region – data center is physically located within China and
has no connection outside of China, including other Azure regions
Availability Z ones
Each availability zone is a physical location within a region
A zone is composed of one or more data centers with independent
power, cooling, and networking facilities.
Azure services that support Availability Zones fall into two categories:
Zonal services – a resource is pinned to a specific zone
Zone-redundant services – replicates automatically across zones
The data moving in and out of Azure data centers, as well as data
moving between Azure data centers, is called bandwidth.
Data transfer to Azure is always free.
Data transfer between Availability Zones is not free.
Data transfer within the same Availability Zone is free.
Data transfer between Azure regions and to other continents is
not free.
